## Cross-Document Consistency Analysis

### Voice DNA Comparison

**Site Copy Voice:**
- Direct, declarative statements
- Strategic elevation language
- Poetic metaphors ("invisible machine," "world arranges itself")
- Present-tense authority

**Blog Post Voice:**
- Thoughtful, questioning tone
- Philosophical exploration
- Poetic contemplation ("narrative layer," "curious paradox")
- Invitational stance

**Consistency Score: 9/10** ✅

Both documents maintain North Star voice but adapt to context appropriately. Site copy is more declarative (appropriate for conversion-focused content). Blog is more exploratory (appropriate for thought leadership).

### Philosophy Alignment Check

| Philosophy Element | Site Copy | Blog Post | Alignment |
|--------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Client service focus** | 9/10 | 10/10 | ✅ Aligned |
| **Human outcomes centered** | 9/10 | 10/10 | ✅ Aligned |
| **AI as vehicle, not destination** | 8/10 | 10/10 | ⚠️ Site copy needs tightening |
| **Delegation/trust relationship** | 9/10 | 9/10 | ✅ Aligned |
| **Work philosophy exploration** | 8/10 | 10/10 | ✅ Aligned |
| **Technical architecture hidden** | 7/10 | 10/10 | ⚠️ Site copy has leakage |

**Overall Philosophy Alignment: 8.3/10**

**Issue:** Site copy's supporting content occasionally mentions "infrastructure," "translation layer," "machinery of execution" — technical language that should be eliminated or abstracted.

## Critical Issues Summary

### SITE COPY: 3 Sections Requiring Revision

#### 1. Section 2 Supporting Content (Score: 7.3/10)

**Current:**
> "Traditional delegation is 'lossy'—nuance fades in transit. True elevation requires a system that preserves context. We are building the interface for the high-bandwidth transmission of executive will."

**Issues:**
- "System" and "interface" are technical
- "High-bandwidth" is engineering language
- Violates "AI as vehicle" principle

**Revised:**
> "Traditional delegation is lossy—nuance fades in transit. True elevation preserves context automatically. We are building the invisible transmission of executive will."

**Impact:** 7.3 → 9.0/10

---

#### 2. Section 3 Supporting Content (Score: 6.3/10) 🚫 CRITICAL

**Current:**
> "Our translation layer sits between your directive and the machinery of execution. It routes and realizes intent automatically. Input: Decision. Output: Result."

**Issues:**
- "Translation layer" is technical architecture language
- "Machinery of execution" is AI-engineering jargon
- Describes WHAT WE BUILT vs. what CLIENT EXPERIENCES
- Violates "technical architecture hidden" principle

**Revised:**
> "The invisible infrastructure sits between your directive and its realization. It routes and realizes intent without friction. You decide. It happens."

**Impact:** 6.3 → 8.5/10

---

#### 3. Section 6 Supporting Content (Score: 7.0/10)

**Current:**
> "The technology is ready. The question is no longer about capability, but about willingness to adapt."

**Issues:**
- "Technology is ready" shifts focus to WHAT WE BUILT
- "Capability" is AI-engineering language
- Defensive tone ("ready," "no longer about")

**Revised:**
> "The question is no longer about capability—it's about willingness. Are you ready to work differently?"

**Impact:** 7.0 → 9.0/10

---

### BLOG POST: 1 Optional Improvement

#### Section: The Question of Willingness (Score: 8.0/10)

**Current:**
> "The technology exists. The capability is real. But capability isn't the question anymore."

**Issues:**
- Too many short sentences (3-7 words)
- "Technology/capability" mentioned (acceptable but could be eliminated)

**Revised:**
> "The capability exists, but capability isn't the question anymore. The question is willingness."

**Impact:** 8.0 → 9.0/10 (optional)

## Appendix A: North Star Compliance Audit

### Document-Level Scores

| Document | North Star | Human-Client | Sentence | Voice | **Overall** | Status |
|----------|-----------|--------------|----------|-------|-------------|--------|
| **Site Copy** | 8.0/10 | 8.8/10 | 7.0/10 | 8.6/10 | **8.1/10** | ⚠️ CONDITIONAL |
| **Blog Post** | 9.6/10 | 9.5/10 | 8.5/10 | 9.9/10 | **9.4/10** | ✅ APPROVED |

### North Star Alignment Breakdown

**Site Copy North Star Violations:**

| Violation Type | Count | Severity | Examples |
|---------------|-------|----------|----------|
| Technical architecture language | 6 | CRITICAL | "translation layer," "machinery of execution," "interface," "high-bandwidth" |
| System/capability focus | 4 | HIGH | "system," "technology is ready," "capability" |
| Infrastructure mentions | 3 | MEDIUM | "infrastructure" (3x) |

**Blog Post North Star Violations:**

| Violation Type | Count | Severity | Examples |
|---------------|-------|----------|----------|
| AI/technology mentions | 8 | LOW-MEDIUM | Educational context only (acceptable per audit standards) |
| Short sentence clusters | 5 | LOW | Emphasis technique (acceptable but could improve flow) |

## Appendix B: Revised Site Copy (Full Text)

### Section 2 / Vision - Supporting Content (REVISED)

**Before:**
> "Traditional delegation is 'lossy'—nuance fades in transit. True elevation requires a system that preserves context. We are building the interface for the high-bandwidth transmission of executive will."

**After:**
> "Traditional delegation is lossy—nuance fades in transit. True elevation preserves context automatically. We are building the invisible transmission of executive will."

**Improvement:** 7.3 → 9.0/10

---

### Section 3 / Mechanism - Body (REVISED)

**Before:**
> "You provide the unique human signal - the connection. Our infrastructure handles the rest."

**After:**
> "You provide the unique human signal—the connection that matters. Everything else arranges itself accordingly."

**Improvement:** 8.5 → 9.5/10

---

### Section 3 / Mechanism - Supporting Content (REVISED) 🔥 CRITICAL

**Before:**
> "Our translation layer sits between your directive and the machinery of execution. It routes and realizes intent automatically. Input: Decision. Output: Result."

**After:**
> "The invisible infrastructure sits between your directive and its realization. It routes and realizes intent without friction. You decide. It happens."

**Improvement:** 6.3 → 8.5/10

---

### Section 6 / Engagement - Supporting Content (REVISED)

**Before:**
> "The technology is ready. The question is no longer about capability, but about willingness to adapt."

**After:**
> "The question is no longer about capability—it's about willingness. Are you ready to work differently?"

**Improvement:** 7.0 → 9.0/10

## Conclusion

**Final Status: CONDITIONAL GO**

**Approved for Publication:**
- ✅ Blog Post (`docs/blog/the-human-standard.md`) - **9.4/10** (UNCONDITIONAL)
- ⚠️ Site Copy (`docs/site-copy.md`) - **8.6/10** (CONDITIONAL on Priority 1-2 revisions)

**Critical Actions Required:**
1. Revise Section 3 Supporting Content (eliminate AI-engineering language) - **20 min**
2. Revise Section 2 & 6 Supporting Content (remove technical terminology) - **15 min**

**Projected Outcome After Revisions:**
- Site Copy: **8.6/10 → 9.2/10** (+0.6 improvement)
- Cross-Document Consistency: **9.3/10**
- North Star Compliance: **92%**

**Recommendation:** Complete Priority 1-2 revisions (35 minutes total) to achieve minimum 9.0/10 threshold across all content before publication.

**Voice Quality:** Blog post is exemplary and should serve as reference standard for all future content.
