## 🎓 Key Learnings

### Voice Guidelines Validated

**DO (What Works):**
- Focus on client experience and outcomes
- Use service/delegation relationship language
- Keep AI tucked beneath surface (vehicle, not destination)
- Explore work philosophy and human thinking
- Ask questions about willingness and change

**DON'T (What Violates):**
- Explain AI architecture or technical implementation
- List AI capabilities as value propositions
- Use engineering terminology (ontological, cognitive architecture, etc.)
- Write for AI engineers instead of business leaders
- Make AI the subject instead of the lens

---

### Content Strategy Principles

**Approved Pattern:**
> "What if we could work with intelligence that understands context like a person does?"
(Human experience, relational, exploratory)

**Rejected Pattern:**
> "We are building Service-as-a-Software with anthropomorphic cognitive architecture."
(AI engineering, technical, capability-focused)

---

## 🔄 Maintenance Recommendations

### Future Content Review Process

**Before Publication:**
1. Run through 5 voice compliance tests
2. Check for AI-engineering red flags (see audit appendix)
3. Verify subject is CLIENT EXPERIENCE (not AI capability)
4. Confirm AI is vehicle/lens (not destination/subject)
5. Test reader outcome: work philosophy vs. technology learning

**Editorial Standards:**
- Keep AI-engineering language below 5% (current approved content)
- Maintain human-client focus above 90%
- Preserve service relationship framing
- Continue philosophical exploration approach
