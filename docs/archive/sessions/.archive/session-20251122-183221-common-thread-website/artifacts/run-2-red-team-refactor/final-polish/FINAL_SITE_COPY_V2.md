## Site Copy

### 01 / State of Mind
**Title:** Thought. Signal. *Action.*
**Body:** The distance between intent and execution is about to disappear.
**Supporting Content:**
**Core Mission**
> Friction between strategic intent and operational reality kills momentum. We exist to remove that latency.
>
> We return time to its most valuable owner: the human mind.

### 02 / Vision
**Title:** Elevation.
**Body:** There is a version of your business where you simply direct, and the world arranges itself accordingly.
**Supporting Content:**
**True Elevation**
> Traditional delegation is "lossy"—nuance fades in transit. True elevation requires a system that preserves context.
>
> We are building the interface for the high-bandwidth transmission of executive will.

### 03 / Mechanism
**Title:** The Invisible Machine.
**Body:** You provide the unique human signal - the connection. The infrastructure handles the rest.
**Supporting Content:**
**The Translation Layer**
> The invisible infrastructure sits between your directive and the machinery of execution. It routes and realizes intent automatically.
>
> Input: Decision. Output: Result.

### 04 / Value
**Title:** Return to the Essential.
**Body:** When the process is invisible, the connection becomes infinite.
**Supporting Content:**
**Human Focus**
> Automation isn't about removing the human; it's about removing the robot from the human. Focus on high-leverage creation.
>
> The ROI is not just efficiency. It is sanity.

### 05 / Leadership
**Title:** The Architects.
**Body:** We are stewards of connection, ensuring technology amplifies human intent.
**Supporting Content:**

**Derek Yellin**
*Chief Executive Officer*
> Defining the human vector.

**Justyn Clark**
*Chief Technology Officer*
> Building the invisible machine.

### 06 / Engagement
**Title:** Begin the Transition.
**Body:** Identify the gap between your potential and your reality.
**Supporting Content:**
**Next Steps**
> The question is about willingness to adapt.

## Changes Applied (V1 → V2)

### Line 38: "Our translation layer" → "The invisible infrastructure"
**Reason:** Removes possessive tech reference, maintains metaphor

### Line 37: "Our infrastructure" → "The infrastructure"
**Reason:** Shifts ownership from company to system

### Line 71: Removed "The technology is ready. The question is no longer about capability"
**Reason:** Eliminates technology capability focus, keeps philosophical question
