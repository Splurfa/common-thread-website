### Document: `docs/site-copy.md` (APPROVED)

#### ✅ ACCEPTABLE - Minimal AI Language

| Line | Language | Status | Notes |
|------|----------|--------|-------|
| 38 | "Our translation layer sits between your directive and the machinery of execution" | BORDERLINE | Tucked beneath client experience language. Acceptable. |
| 42 | "Input: Decision. Output: Result." | ACCEPTABLE | Simple, not technical |
| 49 | "Automation isn't about removing the human; it's about removing the robot from the human" | EXCELLENT | Human-outcome focused |
| 64 | "Building the invisible machine" | ACCEPTABLE | Metaphor, not engineering explanation |

**Score: 8/10** - Focus remains on CLIENT EXPERIENCE (elevation, sanity, connection) with AI tucked beneath the surface.

#### Minor Improvements Suggested:

| Line | Current | Suggested Improvement |
|------|---------|----------------------|
| 38 | "Our translation layer" | "The invisible infrastructure" |
| 71 | "The technology is ready. The question is no longer about capability" | Remove this line - shifts focus to technology |

---

### Document: `docs/blog/the-human-standard.md` (APPROVED)

#### ✅ EXCELLENT - Human-Focused Philosophy

| Line | Language | Status | Notes |
|------|----------|--------|-------|
| 4 | "What if AI agents were designed not to mimic worker productivity, but to mirror how humans actually think?" | EXCELLENT | Asks philosophical question, not technical explanation |
| 6 | "They solve isolated problems without understanding context. They forget what they learned." | EXCELLENT | Describes EXPERIENCE, not architecture |
| 8 | "We believe this is a fundamental design choice—not a limitation, but a choice." | EXCELLENT | Philosophical stance |
| 17-22 | Episodic/Procedural/Semantic memory discussion | ACCEPTABLE | Educational context about HUMAN thinking, not AI engineering |
| 54 | "Not code. Not configuration. Just language—the way you already talk to people." | EXCELLENT | Client experience focus |
| 63 | "There's something appealing about the idea of a machine that fades into the background." | EXCELLENT | Human desire, not technical capability |
| 68 | "Not as tools to configure, but as intelligences to direct. Not as replacements for thinking, but as extensions of it." | EXCELLENT | Human relationship framing |
| 86 | "It's the belief that AI should work like humans think, not like machines execute." | EXCELLENT | Philosophy statement |

**Score: 9/10** - Exceptional human-client focus. AI is vehicle for exploring work philosophy, not the destination.

#### Minor Flagged Items (EDUCATIONAL, NOT VIOLATIONS):

| Line | Content | Status | Reasoning |
|------|---------|--------|-----------|
| 17-22 | Memory types explanation | ACCEPTABLE | Explains HOW HUMANS THINK (educational) not how AI works (engineering) |
| 32-42 | Decision layers | ACCEPTABLE | Describes HUMAN wisdom, uses AI as mirror to explore human cognition |

**Note:** This document uses AI as a lens to discuss **human work philosophy** - exactly the right approach.

## 3. Cross-Content Alignment Analysis

### Voice Consistency Matrix

| Element | Site Copy | Blog v1 | Blog v2 | Alignment |
|---------|-----------|---------|---------|-----------|
| **Primary Subject** | Client elevation | Work philosophy | AI architecture | ❌ Blog v2 misaligned |
| **AI Visibility** | Beneath surface | Tucked/vehicle | Front and center | ❌ Blog v2 violates |
| **Language Style** | Metaphoric, human | Thoughtful, questioning | Technical, engineering | ❌ Blog v2 wrong voice |
| **Reader Outcome** | "I could work differently" | "This makes me think" | "Now I understand the tech" | ❌ Blog v2 wrong outcome |
| **Relationship Framing** | Service/delegation | Collaboration/extension | Tool/capability | ❌ Blog v2 violates |

### Voice DNA Comparison

**Site Copy Voice:**
> "The distance between intent and execution is about to disappear."
> "The ROI is not just efficiency. It is sanity."
> "We return time to its most valuable owner: the human mind."

**Blog v1 Voice:**
> "What if AI agents were designed not to mimic worker productivity, but to mirror how humans actually think?"
> "Not as tools to configure, but as intelligences to direct."
> "It's the belief that AI should work like humans think, not like machines execute."

**Blog v2 Voice:**
> "We are building Service-as-a-Software (SaaS 2.0): a digital workforce that does not just do, but thinks."
> "The Multi-Tiered Ontological Engine"
> "Anthropomorphic Cognitive Architecture"

**Analysis:** Blog v2 reads like AI product documentation, not work philosophy. Complete voice mismatch.

---

### Philosophy Alignment Check

**Core Philosophy Elements:**

| Philosophy Element | Site Copy | Blog v1 | Blog v2 | Status |
|--------------------|-----------|---------|---------|---------|
| **Client service focus** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | Blog v2 fails |
| **Human outcomes centered** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | Blog v2 fails |
| **AI as vehicle, not destination** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | Blog v2 fails |
| **Delegation/trust relationship** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | Blog v2 fails |
| **Work philosophy exploration** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | Blog v2 fails |
| **Technical architecture hidden** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | Blog v2 fails |

**Conclusion:** `docs/The Human Standard.md` (Blog v2) violates EVERY philosophy element.

---

## 4. Final Recommendation

### GO/NO-GO Assessment

**🚫 NO-GO for Blog v2** (`docs/The Human Standard.md`)

**Reasons:**
1. **Voice violation**: Reads like AI-engineering documentation
2. **Philosophy violation**: Explains HOW technology works instead of what CLIENT EXPERIENCES
3. **Audience mismatch**: Written for AI engineers, not business leaders
4. **Complete rewrite required**: Cannot be salvaged with minor edits
5. **Superior alternative exists**: Blog v1 already achieves desired voice

---

### Required Actions Before Approval

#### IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:

**DELETE:** `docs/The Human Standard.md`

**REASON:** This document cannot be edited into compliance. It would require rewriting 90%+ of content.

**PROMOTE:** `docs/blog/the-human-standard.md` → Use as canonical blog post

**REASON:** Already achieves 9/10 human-client focus with correct voice.

---

#### OPTIONAL IMPROVEMENTS: Site Copy

**Minor polish suggestions for `docs/site-copy.md`:**

| Line | Current | Suggested Change | Priority |
|------|---------|------------------|----------|
| 38 | "Our translation layer" | "The invisible infrastructure" | LOW |
| 71 | "The technology is ready. The question is no longer about capability" | Remove (shifts focus to tech) | MEDIUM |
| 37 | "Our infrastructure handles the rest" | "It handles the rest" | LOW |

**Estimated impact:** +0.5 score improvement (8.0 → 8.5/10)

---

#### OPTIONAL IMPROVEMENTS: Blog v1

**Minor refinements for `docs/blog/the-human-standard.md`:**

| Line | Current | Suggested Change | Priority |
|------|---------|------------------|----------|
| 24 | "What would it mean to design AI systems that operate through these three layers?" | "What would it mean to work with intelligence that thinks this way?" | LOW |
| 70 | "But we're exploring what it could mean if AI systems were built around human cognition" | "But we're exploring what it could mean to work with intelligence that understands context like a person does" | MEDIUM |

**Estimated impact:** +0.5 score improvement (9.0 → 9.5/10)

---

### Content Strategy Recommendation

**PRIMARY CONTENT:**
- **Site Copy:** Use `docs/site-copy.md` (current version acceptable, minor polish optional)
- **Blog Post:** Use `docs/blog/the-human-standard.md` (current version excellent)

**ARCHIVE/DELETE:**
- **Blog v2:** Delete `docs/The Human Standard.md` (AI-engineering violation)

**VOICE GOVERNANCE:**
All future content must pass this test:
> "Does this describe what the CLIENT EXPERIENCES or what the AI DOES?"

If answer is "what the AI does" → reject and rewrite.
