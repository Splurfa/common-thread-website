# The Experience Economy Fallacy

**Excerpt:** Most experiences can be productized. What survives is connection through repeated return.

---

The experience economy promised differentiation through memorable moments. Create an experience, charge a premium. It became doctrine.

## The Productization Trap

Most experiences can be productized. The craft brewery becomes a distribution network. The boutique hotel becomes a franchise template. The artisanal process becomes a workflow anyone can execute. Differentiation fades.

What survives is not the experience itself. It is the connection that makes someone return.

There is a version of your business where customers come back not because the product changed, but because the relationship deepened. Not novelty. Connection.

## The Return Pattern

The pattern repeats across industries. Coffee shops with identical beans and similar ambiance create wildly different loyalty. Consulting firms with matching credentials retain completely different clients. Software platforms with comparable features generate opposite retention curves.

The difference is proximity over time. Repeated interactions. Accumulated context. Understanding that compounds.

This is not sentiment. It is structure. When someone returns, they bring history. Previous conversations. Shared references. Patterns you both recognize. The transaction becomes faster because the foundation already exists.

The ROI is not in the experience. It is in the repetition that builds connection.

## The Memory Fallacy

Most businesses optimize for the first impression. Onboarding sequences. Welcome experiences. Launch moments. They invest everything in the entry point and assume the experience will carry forward.

It does not. The experience becomes a memory. Memories fade. Competition copies. The advantage disappears.

What compounds is connection. Each interaction either deepens understanding or resets to zero. Depth. Consistency. Return.

## The Recognized Thread

There is a version of your customer relationships where value accumulates rather than resets. Where the tenth interaction is fundamentally different from the first because context has built. Where switching costs are not contractual but relational.

This is the work most businesses avoid. Creating experiences is creative. Building connection is repetitive. Experiences can be designed in isolation. Connection requires showing up.

The experience economy sold the wrong metric. Memorable is not sustainable. Repeatable is not the same as returned-to. The question is not whether they remember you. It is whether they come back.

When they come back, connection builds. When connection builds, the transaction changes. What was once evaluated becomes assumed. What required explanation becomes understood. The relationship carries the work the experience cannot.

This is not process. It is presence. The willingness to be there when they return. To remember what came before. To make the second conversation different from the first.

Most delegation breaks this. The context transfers to someone new. The connection resets. The customer returns but the relationship does not recognize them. The experience might be identical, but the thread is lost.

The real work is maintaining the thread. Creating conditions where return is possible. Where history accumulates. Where the relationship recognizes itself.

The experience economy measured the wrong thing. It optimized for memorability when it should have optimized for return. For connection that survives repetition. For relationships that recognize their own history.

That is what survives productization. Not the experience. The connection.
