# Designing Work for Humans

**Excerpt:** Automation does not eliminate work. It returns humans to the work only humans can do.

---

Calum Chace describes radical abundance: a world where automation handles routine execution and humans focus on judgment, creativity, connection. The resources exist. The technology exists. What is missing is the design.

## The Inversion Problem

Most businesses automate the wrong things. They remove human touch from customer interaction. They systematize the moments that require nuance. They optimize for efficiency and lose the connection that creates value.

The result is not abundance. It is friction. Customers interact with systems that cannot understand context. Employees execute workflows that strip judgment from decision-making. Everyone is busy but nothing deepens.

There is a version of automation that works differently. One that handles translation, coordination, execution while humans focus on strategy, relationship, insight. Not replacing humans. Repositioning them.

## The Leverage Question

This requires different design. Most automation asks: what can we remove humans from? The better question is: what should humans never have been doing in the first place?

Humans should not translate intent across organizational boundaries. They should not chase context through email threads. They should not recreate wheels because knowledge lives in someone else's head. These are coordination problems, not human problems.

Humans should make judgments that require accumulated context. Build relationships that deepen over time. Connect patterns across domains. Create strategies that account for what systems cannot see.

The difference is leverage. Low-leverage work is humans compensating for broken systems. High-leverage work is humans doing what only humans can do. Judgment. Connection. Synthesis.

## The Capability Match

Most organizations are inverted. Senior people spend hours in coordination meetings. Strategic thinkers manage inbox volume. Relationship builders get pulled into process enforcement. The highest-leverage humans do the lowest-leverage work.

Automation could fix this. Not by removing humans from the equation, but by removing the work that should never have required human time. Translation. Synchronization. Tribal knowledge retrieval.

When those disappear, different work becomes possible. The strategist thinks without meeting overhead. The relationship builder focuses on connection without administrative burden. The expert judges without translating across systems.

This is not efficiency. It is sanity. Returning humans to work that matches human capability.

## The Hidden Cost

The pattern shows up across domains. Software engineering spends more time on coordination than creation. Medical professionals spend more time on documentation than diagnosis. Teachers spend more time on administration than teaching.

In each case, automation is available. What is missing is the willingness to redesign around human leverage rather than organizational inertia.

There is a version of your organization where people do the work they were hired to do. Where strategic thinking happens during work hours, not around them. Where expertise is applied to problems, not to navigating systems.

## The Design Intention

The path is not removing humans. It is removing everything that dilutes human impact. The coordination tax. The context translation layer. The tribal knowledge bottleneck.

What remains is high-leverage human work. Strategic judgment informed by accumulated context. Relationship depth that compounds over time. Creative synthesis that connects patterns systems cannot see.

This is the abundance Chace describes. Not a world without work. A world where work matches capability. Where humans operate at the level only humans can reach.

Most businesses fear this. They see automation as job elimination rather than job evolution. They protect low-leverage work because headcount equals value. They resist redesign because current systems are known.

The cost is human potential. People capable of strategic insight spend their time on coordination. Relationship builders manage process. Creative thinkers navigate bureaucracy.

Automation should free this. Not by replacing humans, but by removing the work that buries them. The goal is not fewer people. It is higher-leverage people.

When coordination is automatic, strategy becomes possible. When translation is invisible, connection becomes infinite. When knowledge is accessible, expertise is applied rather than searched for.

This is designing work for humans. Not around humans. For the capabilities only humans possess. Judgment. Connection. Synthesis.

The technology exists. The resources exist. What is required is intention. The willingness to ask not what can be automated, but what should humans have always been freed to do.

That is the design problem. That is where abundance lives.
